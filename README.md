Handwritten Digit Recognition System
This repository contains a complete solution for recognizing handwritten digits using a neural network model built with TensorFlow and Keras.

Features:

Data Handling: Loads and normalizes the MNIST dataset for training and evaluation.
Model Architecture: Implements a feedforward neural network with a Flatten layer and two Dense layers.
Training: Trains the model on MNIST data for 10 epochs and evaluates its accuracy.
Image Processing: Provides functionality to preprocess new handwritten digit images for prediction.
Visualization: Displays sample training images and prediction results using Matplotlib.
Technologies Used:

Python: Programming language for implementing the solution.
TensorFlow & Keras: Libraries for building and training the neural network.
Matplotlib: Used for visualizing images and predictions.
PIL (Pillow): For image processing and preprocessing.
Usage:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Install dependencies: pip install tensorflow matplotlib pillow
Place a handwritten digit image as digits.png.jpeg in the working directory.
Run the script: python digit_recognition.py
View the output and visualizations.
Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute to enhance the functionality. For any issues or enhancements, please open an issue or a pull request.
